		<h4>How It Works</h4>
	</div>
		<p>
			Switch mode power supplies, like any other power supplies, convert AC/DC to (Usually lower voltage) DC. They, however, differ in many ways.
		</p><ol>
			<li>Unlike a linear power supply, the pass transistor of a switching-mode supply continually switches between low-dissipation, full-on and full-off states, and spends very little time in the high dissipation transitions, which minimizes wasted energy. A hypothetical ideal switched-mode power supply dissipates no power. Voltage regulation is achieved by varying the ratio of on-to-off time (also known as duty cycles). In contrast, a linear power supply regulates the output voltage by continually dissipating power in the pass transistor. This higher power conversion efficiency is an important advantage of a switched-mode power supply. </li>
			<li>This leads to several advantages:</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Lower Conversion Losses (Up to 96% Efficiency) </li>
				<li>Smaller Size</li>
				<li>Lower Noise</li>
			</ul>
				<li>Along with Several Disadvantages:</li>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Greater Complexity<br>
				</li>

				<li>
					More Noise introduces on the output (from high frequency switching)<br>
				</li>
			</ul>
		</ol>

			<ul>
				<li>
					A: Input EMI filtering and bridge rectifier;
				</li>
				<li>
					B: Input filter capacitors;
					"Between" B and C: primary side heat sink;
				</li>
				<li>
					C: Transformer;
					Between C and D: secondary side heat sink;
				</li>
				<li>
					D: Output filter coil;
				</li>
				<li>
					E: Output filter capacitors.
				</li>
				<li>
					The coil and large yellow capacitor below E are additional input filtering components that are mounted directly on the power input connector and are not part of the main circuit board. ATX power supplies provide at least 5 independent voltage outputs..
