                        <td>Heatsinks for high power linear regulators add size and weight. Transformers, if used, are large due to low operating frequency (mains power frequency is at 50 or 60 Hz); otherwise can be compact due to low component count.</td>
                        <td>Smaller transformer (if used; else inductor) due to higher operating frequency (typically 50 kHz – 1 MHz). Size and weight of adequate RF shielding may be significant.</td>
                        <td>A transformer&#39;s power handling capacity of given size and weight increases with frequency provided that hysteresis losses can be kept down. Therefore, higher operating frequency means either a higher capacity or smaller transformer.</td>

                        <td>If regulated: efficiency largely depends on voltage difference between input and output; output voltage is regulated by dissipating excess power as heat resulting in a typical efficiency of 30–40%.[27] If unregulated, transformer iron and copper losses may be the only significant sources of inefficiency.</td>
                        <td>Output is regulated using duty cycle control; the transistors are switched fully on or fully off, so very little resistive losses between input and the load. The only heat generated is in the non-ideal aspects of the components and quiescent current in the control circuitry.</td>
                        <td>Switching losses in the transistors (especially in the short part of each cycle when the device is partially on), on-resistance of the switching transistors, equivalent series resistance in the inductor and capacitors, and core losses in the inductor, and rectifier voltage drop contribute to a typical efficiency of 60–70%. However, by optimizing SMPS design (such as choosing the optimal switching frequency, avoiding saturation of inductors, and active rectification), the amount of power loss and heat can be minimized; a good design can have an efficiency of 95%.</td>

                        <td>Unregulated may be simply a diode and capacitor; regulated has a voltage-regulating circuit and a noise-filtering capacitor; usually a simpler circuit (and simpler feedback loop stability criteria) than switched-mode circuits.</td>
                        <td>Consists of a controller IC, one or several power transistors and diodes as well as a power transformer, inductors, and filter capacitors. Some design complexities present (reducing noise/interference; extra limitations on maximum ratings of transistors at high switching speeds) not found in linear regulator circuits.</td>
                        <td>In switched-mode mains (AC-to-DC) supplies, multiple voltages can be generated by one transformer core, but that can introduce design/use complications: for example it may place minimum output current restrictions on one output. For this SMPSs have to use duty cycle control. One of the outputs has to be chosen to feed the voltage regulation feedback loop (usually 3.3 V or 5 V loads are more fussy about their supply voltages than the 12 V loads, so this drives the decision as to which feeds the feedback loop. The other outputs usually track the regulated one pretty well). Both need a careful selection of their transformers. Due to the high operating frequencies in SMPSs, the stray inductance and capacitance of the printed circuit board traces become important.</td>

                        <td>Unregulated PSUs may have a little AC ripple superimposed upon the DC component at twice mains frequency (100–120 Hz). It can cause audible mains hum in audio equipment, brightness ripples or banded distortions in analog security cameras.</td>
                        <td>Noisier due to the switching frequency of the SMPS. An unfiltered output may cause glitches in digital circuits or noise in audio circuits.</td>
                        <td>This can be suppressed with capacitors and other filtering circuitry in the output stage. With a switched mode PSU the switching frequency can be chosen to keep the noise out of the circuits working frequency band (e.g., for audio systems above the range of human hearing)</td>

                        <td>Very low cost SMPS may couple electrical switching noise back onto the mains power line, causing interference with A/V equipment connected to the same phase. Non power-factor-corrected SMPSs also cause harmonic distortion.</td>
                        <td>This can be prevented if a (properly earthed) EMI/RFI filter is connected between the input terminals and the bridge rectifier.</td>

                        <td>Ranging from very low to medium since a simple SMPS without PFC draws current spikes at the peaks of the AC sinusoid.</td>
                        <td>Active/passive power factor correction in the SMPS can offset this problem and are even required by some electric regulation authorities, particularly in the EU. The internal resistance of low-power transformers in linear power supplies usually limits the peak current each cycle and thus gives a better power factor than many switched-mode power supplies that directly rectify the mains with little series resistance.</td>

                        <td>Empty filter capacitors initially draw large amounts of current as they charge up, with larger capacitors drawing larger amounts of peak current. Being many times above the normal operating current, this greatly stresses components subject to the surge, complicates fuse selection to avoid nuisance blowing and may cause problems with equipment employing overcurrent protection such as uninterruptible power supplies. Mitigated by use of a suitable soft-start circuit or series resistor.</td>

Dangerous if primary/secondary insulation breaks down, unlikely with reasonable design. Transformerless mains-operated supply dangerous. In both linear and switch-mode the mains, and possibly the output voltages, are hazardous and must be well-isolated.</td>
                        <td>Common rail of equipment (including casing) is energized to half the mains voltage, but at high impedance, unless equipment is earthed/grounded or doesn&#39;t contain EMI/RFI filtering at the input terminals.</td>
                        <td>Due to regulations concerning EMI/RFI radiation, many SMPS contain EMI/RFI filtering at the input stage consisting of capacitors and inductors before the bridge rectifier. Two capacitors are connected in series with the Live and Neutral rails with the Earth connection in between the two capacitors. This forms a capacitive divider that energizes the common rail at half mains voltage. Its high impedance current source can provide a tingling or a &#39;bite&#39; to the operator or can be exploited to light an Earth Fault LED. However, this current may cause nuisance tripping on the most sensitive residual-current devices. In power supplies without a ground pin (like USB charger) there is EMI/RFI capacitor placed between primary and secondary side.[28] It can also provide some very mild tingling sensation but it&#39;s safe to the user.[29]</td>

Can in some cases destroy input stages in amplifiers if floating voltage exceeds transistor base-emitter breakdown voltage, causing the transistor&#39;s gain to drop and noise levels to increase.[30] Mitigated by good failsafe design. Failure of a component in the SMPS itself can cause further damage to other PSU components; can be difficult to troubleshoot.</td>
                        <td>The floating voltage is caused by capacitors bridging the primary and secondary sides of the power supply. Connection to earthed equipment will cause a momentary (and potentially destructive) spike in current at the connector as the voltage at the secondary side of the capacitor equalizes to earth potential.</td>
